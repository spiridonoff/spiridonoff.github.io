My Name is Artin Spiridonoff. I'm a 4th year PhD student in Systems Engineering at Boston University.
My Research is about Distributed Optimization. I study optimization algorithms to minimize functions (convex or nonconvex) in a distributed (parallel or decentralized) setting. Optimization algorithms are used in every Machine Learning or Deep Learning algorithms with vast interesting applications.
