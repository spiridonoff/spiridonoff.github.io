### About Me:
My Name is Artin Spiridonoff. I'm a 4th year PhD student in Systems Engineering at Boston University.
My Research is about Distributed Optimization. I study optimization algorithms to minimize functions (convex or nonconvex) in a distributed (parallel or decentralized) setting. Optimization algorithms are used in every Machine Learning or Deep Learning algorithms with vast interesting applications.

I got my Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, where I became interested in Control Systems and designed a quaternion-based PID controller for a quadrotor as my thesis project.

Prior to that, I went to Allame Tabatabaei Highschool where I discovered my interest in mathematics and participated in 28th Iranian National Mathematical Olympiad and won the Gold medal. This victory not only paved the path for my following educational decisions, it introduced me to many brilliant and tallented people whome I'm proud to be friends with.

If it's not obvious by now, I have a boundless enthusiast to solve difficult mathematical and analytical problems. My other interests and hobbies include playing piano, working out, skiing and hiking, listening to music, watching some good old SNL comedy or following the latest news and trends.
